## Contributing

Contributions are gratefully accepted. To contribute code, fork our GitHub repo and send a pull request.

## Building from source

Consider downloading a [pre-compiled mumax¬≥ binary](https://mumax.github.io/download.html).

If you want to compile nevertheless, 4 essential components will be required to build mumax¬≥: an ***NVIDIA driver***, ***Go***, ***CUDA*** and ***C***.

* *If they are not yet present on your system*: install them as detailed below.
* *If they are already installed*: check if they work correctly by running the *check* for each component written below.

<details><summary><b><i>Install an NVIDIA driver</i></b></summary>

* **Windows**: Find a suitable driver [here](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/).
* **Linux**: [Install the NVIDIA proprietary driver](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/unix/). <!-- version 440.44 recommended --><details><summary>Troubleshooting Linux &rarr;click here&larr;</summary>
  If the following error occurs, proceed as follows:

  ```batch
  nvidia-smi has failed because it couldn't communicate with the NVIDIA driver. Make sure that the latest NVIDIA driver is installed and running
  ```

  1) Check for existing NVIDIA drivers.
      * Run `dpkg -l | grep nvidia` to see if any NVIDIA drivers are installed.
      * If it shows some drivers, you might want to uninstall them before proceeding with the clean installation: `sudo apt-get --purge remove '*nvidia*'`
  2) Update system packages. Make sure your system is up to date with `sudo apt update` and `sudo apt upgrade`.
  3) (Optional but recommended:) Add the official NVIDIA PPA to ensure you have access to the latest NVIDIA drivers with `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa` and `sudo apt update`.
  4) Install the recommended driver. Ubuntu can automatically detect and recommend the right NVIDIA driver for your system with the command `ubuntu-drivers devices`. This will list the available drivers for your GPU and mark the recommended one. <br> To install the recommended NVIDIA driver, use `sudo apt install nvidia-driver-<version>` (replace `<version>` with the number of the recommended driver e.g., nvidia-driver-535)
  5) Reboot your system with `sudo reboot` to apply the changes.

  6) Verify the installation with `nvidia-smi`. This returns something like this, which shows you the driver version in the top center:

* **WSL**: Follow the instructions and troubleshooting for Linux above. If you encounter issues/errors during that process, see the troubleshooting section below: <details><summary>Troubleshooting WSL &rarr;click here&larr;</summary>
    When using Windows Subsystem for Linux, your graphics card might not be recognized. If an error occurs after running the command:

    1) If `ubuntu-drivers devices` throws the error
        * `Command 'ubuntu-drivers' not found`: run the command `sudo apt install ubuntu-drivers-common`.
        * `ERROR:root:aplay command not found`: run the command `sudo apt install alsa-utils`.
    2) If `sudo apt install nvidia-driver-<version>` throws the error `E: Unable to locate package nvidia-driver-<version>`: run the commands

        ```bash
        sudo apt install software-properties-gtk
        sudo add-apt-repository universe
        sudo add-apt-repository multiverse
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install nvidia-driver-<version> 
        ```

    3) If `nvidia-smi` throws the error `nvidia: command not found`: the controller is probably not using the correct interface (`sudo lshw -c display` should show NVIDIA). To solve this, follow [these steps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/gpu-compute). If a `docker: permission denied` error occurs: close and re-open WSL.

<details><summary><b><i>Install CUDA</i></b> - ‚ö†Ô∏èInstall in a directory without spaces‚ö†Ô∏è</summary>

* **Windows**: Download an installer from [the CUDA website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).
  * ‚ö†Ô∏è **The installation directory should not contain spaces, if possible install in `C:\cuda`.**
    <details><summary><i>Click here if CUDA was installed elsewhere.</i></summary>

    You can define these two environment variables to help the compiler find CUDA (replace `%CUDA_PATH%` below by your CUDA installation directory, e.g. `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v12.1`).

    ```bash
    CGO_CFLAGS = '-I "%CUDA_PATH%\include"'
    CGO_LDFLAGS = '-L "%CUDA_PATH%\lib\x64"
    ```

     Alternatively, every time before you run the `make` command to build mumax¬≥, you can run the two lines above (but both prepended with `$env:`) in Powershell (NOT cmd).
    </details>

* **Linux**: Use `sudo apt-get install nvidia-cuda-toolkit`, or [download an installer](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).
  * Pick the default installation path. **If this is not `usr/local/cuda/`, create a symlink to that path.**
  * Match the version shown in your driver (see top right in `nvidia-smi` output).
  * When prompted what to install: do not install the driver again, only the CUDA toolkit.
  * Add the CUDA `bin` and `lib64` paths to your `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` by adding the following lines at the end of your shell profile file (usually `.bashrc` for Bash):

    ```bash
    export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    ```

    Apply the changes with `source ~/.bashrc`.

üëâ *Check CUDA installation with: `nvcc --version`*

<details><summary><b><i>Install Go</i></b></summary>

* Download and install from [the Go website](https://go.dev/doc/install).
* The `GOPATH` environment variable should have been set automatically (note: the folder it points to probably doesn't exist yet).<br>*Check with `go env GOPATH`.* <details><summary><i>Click here to set `GOPATH` manually if it does not exist.</i></summary>
  * On **Windows:** `%USERPROFILE%/go` is often used, e.g. `C:/Users/<name>/go`.
  * On **Linux:** `~/go` is often used. Open or create the `~/.bashrc` file and add the following lines.

    ```bash
    export GOPATH=$HOME/go
    export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
    ```

    After editing the file, apply the changes by running `source ~/.bashrc`.

üëâ *Check Go installation with: `go version`*

</details>

<details><summary><b><i>Install a C compiler</i></b></summary>

* **Linux:** `sudo apt-get install gcc`
* **Windows:** Download and install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) with the C/C++ extension pack. `gcc` can not be used since CUDA does not support it on Windows. If your installation is successful, you should have the executable `cl.exe`.

üëâ *Check C installation with: `gcc --version` on Linux and `which cl.exe` on Windows.*

With these tools installed, you can build mumax¬≥ yourself.

* Within your `GOPATH` folder, create the subfolders `src/github.com/mumax`.
* Clone the GitHub repository by running `git clone git@github.com:mumax/3.git` in that newly created `mumax` folder.
  * If you don't have git, you can manually fetch the source [here](https://github.com/mumax/3/releases) and unzip it into `$GOPATH/src/github.com/mumax/3`.
* Initialize a Go module by moving to the newly created folder with `cd 3/` and running `go mod init github.com/mumax/3`, followed by `go mod tidy`.
* Query the compute capability of your GPU using the command `nvidia-smi --query-gpu=compute_cap --format=csv`. Based on this, set the environment variable `CUDA_CC`: if your compute capability is e.g., 8.9, then set the value `CUDA_CC=89`.
* You can now compile mumax¬≥ ...
  * ... **on Linux:**

    ```bash
    make realclean && make
    ```

    Your binary is now at `$GOPATH/bin/mumax3`.

  * ... **on Windows:**
    The `Makefile`s can not be run directly on Windows due to issues with whitespaces. Use the `deploy/deploy_windows.ps1` script instead: it is meant to generate the Windows executables for the [mumax¬≥ download page](https://mumax.github.io/download.html), but can also be used to build mumax¬≥ for yourself with some small adjustments:
    1) At the top of the file: change the list of CUDA versions to only contain the CUDA version you have installed.<br>NOTE: if your CUDA version was not in that list, add it to the `switch ( $CUDA_VERSION )` blocks a bit further.
    2) In the second `switch ( $CUDA_VERSION )` block, keep only the compute capability of your own GPU. Otherwise, compilation will take unnecessarily long to account for all other compute capabilities.
    3) Near the middle of the file, change the path `$CCBIN` to your Visual Studio executable, which you can find with `which cl.exe`. Example: if `which cl.exe` returns `foo\bar\cl.exe`, then set `$CCBIN = "foo\bar"`.

    Now you can compile by opening Powershell in the `/deploy` directory and running

    ```bat
    ./deploy_windows.ps1
    ```

    Your executable will be created in the `deploy/build` directory.

* *Check installation with: `which mumax3` and `mumax3 -test`.* <details><summary>Troubleshooting &rarr;click here&larr;</summary>
  If the `cuda.h` and `curand.h` headers can not be found on Windows, read the "Install CUDA" section of this README to set the correct path and environment variables.
